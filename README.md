# entropy-sim 
A simple C++ simulation to visualize how entropy evolves in a particle system.  
The project models two groups of gas particles with different initial temperatures in a 2D box.  
As they collide and mix, the system's entropy is computed and recorded over time,  
illustrating the second law of thermodynamics in action.
